# flareon5-12
Random bits and pieces I wrote to solve the last problem in the Flare-On 5 challenge


`checker.cpp` -> Reversed password checking algorithm

`solve.py` -> Inverted algorithm, prints the flag

`rssb.working.txt` -> Decompiled and partially commented rssb code

`subleq.py` -> Subleq VM/decompiler

`rssb.py` -> RSSB VM/decompiler

`instructions.bin` -> raw instructions, used by the decompilers
